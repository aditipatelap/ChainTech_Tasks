Throughout my academic journey 📖, I've immersed myself in core computer science subjects like Data Structures and Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming, DBMS, and Operating Systems 🖊️. My enthusiasm for learning led me to participate and excel in hackathons and competitions 🎯, where my team achieved recognition as one of India's top 10 teams in the prestigious Samsung Solve for Tomorrow competition. I also clinched second place in a hackathon organized by Ahmedabad University. 🏆

Outside the classroom 🏛️, I've honed my leadership
